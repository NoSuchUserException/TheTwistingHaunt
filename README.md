# TheTwistingHaunt
Codenamed The Twisting Haunt based off of the RPG concept we had, this project seeks to create a combat system meant to be implemented into a larger game system, with a text-based RPG game being the primary target.

Current Goals:

-(WIP)Implement a battlesim where all entities are controlled by a player or players for testing the structure

-(WIP)Implement a basic client to test the classes

-(WIP)Implement consumable item objects to be used by entities capable of using them

-(WIP)Implement an Player subclass of entity, implementing a unique PlayerADT

-(NOT STARTED)Implement "special attack" objects to be contained in a list inside entity

-(NOT STARTED)Implement InvalidTargetClassException for invalid Item uses so as not to "eat" turn.

-(NOT STARTED)Implement a "stupid" RNG ai to speed testing and enhance gameplay

-(NOT STARTED)Implement other subclasses of Entity ie. creature, undead, humaniod, etc

-(NOT STARTED)Implement equipable item list for entities to enhance stats ie. armor, weapons

-(NOT STARTED)Implement smarter ai specific to entity type and based off intelligence to give players a greater challenge

-(NOT STARTED)Implement an advanced client to play a short game using the combat project
